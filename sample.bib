	abstract = {AND OUTLOOK The results of this study indicate that the OPERA-3D model using tracking routines is a suitable tool to describe stray fields in the PS MUs. The lack of magnetic shims in the model is a limitation in describing the operational beam, which will be addressed by adding shim geometries to the model. This work provides the backbone to fully describe the optics from the PS to the East Area, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the stray fields. This will allow for the design of the transfer line modification necessary to deliver the beam sizes needed for CHIMERA as well as the study of the implementation of octupoles to fold the phase space and produce a uniform beam suitable for sample irradiation [15].},

The Proton Synchrotron (PS) has the potential of delivering the required high energy and high-Z (in this case, Pb) ions for radiation tests over the relevant range of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) of ∼ 10 − 40 MeV cm2 mg−1 with a {\textgreater}1 mm penetration depth in silicon, speciﬁcally for Single Event Effect (SEE) tests. This contribution summarises the working group’s progress in demonstrating the feasibility of variable energy slow extraction and over a wide range of intensities. The results of a dedicated 5.4 GeV/��� Pb ion beam test are reported to understand the performance limitations of the beam instrumentation systems needed to characterise the beam in CHARM.},

Studies at the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) are investigating beam loss reduction techniques to improve the efficiency of the beams provided to the experiments of the East Area. Powering octupoles distorts the transverse phase-space of the extracted beam which can be exploited to maximize the number of particles in the field region of the septum with respect to the number lost on the septum. The effect of octupoles on the separatrices near the third-order resonance is simulated with MADX-PTC tools to observe phase space folding and to predict the multipole parameters needed to minimize beam loss. Experimental studies are performed to confirm the validity of the simulation models and to quantify the net benefit of using octupoles to improve the extraction efficiency.},

	abstract = {The CHIMERA† (up to December 2022) and HEARTS‡ (as of January 2023) projects aim to facilitate radiation effects testing of electronics components using heavy ion beams before deployment in harsh radiation environments such as space or high energy accelerators. The required (micro-) electronics reliability assurance testing conditions can be met by using 100 MeV/n - 5 GeV/n Pb ion beams extracted from CERN’s Proton Synchrotron (PS) which have a surface Linear Energy Transfer (LET) range of 10-40 MeV cm2/mg, {\textgreater}1 mm penetration depth in silicon and several cm FWHM beam size. This paper gathers the results from Monte Carlo simulations in FLUKA which were used to understand the transport of ions through the T08 transfer line in the PS East Area, focusing on key effects such as energy straggling, loss of transmission (e.g. through scattering and nuclear fragmentation) and beam size. These calculations served as input for machine development activities and allow us to characterize the radiation field at the testing location, in present and future experimental configurations. The simulation results are compared to instrumentation data obtained during an experimental campaign in November 2022. Potential future upgrades and developments are also discussed.},
